# üé• CoolMovies - Flutter Movie App

Welcome to **CoolMovies**, a Flutter app designed to showcase my skills in mobile development, featuring the BLoC architecture, GraphQL API integration, offline functionality, and more. This project simulates a movie application where users can browse movies, view details, and leave reviews.

## üöÄ Features

- **Movie Listings**: Display a comprehensive list of available movies.
- **Movie Details**: Tap on a movie to open a detailed view that includes all available information about the movie and user reviews.
- **User Reviews**: Each movie page shows all reviews and the average user rating.
- **Create Reviews**: Users can write and submit reviews by entering a rating (0-5 stars), a title, and a description.
- **Offline Support**: Cached data allows users to see movies and reviews when offline. Users can also create reviews while offline, which are synced when back online.
- **Error Handling**: Displays a user-friendly "Something went wrong" screen with a retry option when there's no internet connection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For building the user interface and ensuring a smooth, cross-platform experience.
- **BLoC Architecture**: To manage state efficiently and separate the app into well-structured layers:
  - **Presentation**: UI components and user interactions.
  - **Business Logic**: Handles the application logic, powered by BLoC.
  - **Data**: Manages repositories and GraphQL API interactions.
- **GraphQL API**: For fetching data about movies and reviews from the backend.
- **Local Caching**: Ensures data is available when the user is offline and allows for review submissions to be synced once the device is back online.

## üíæ Important Notes

One of the key highlights of this project is the use of **conventional commits**. The commit messages follow best practices to ensure clarity and consistency throughout the development process, making it easier to track changes and improvements in the codebase.
